# Programming Language
I am choosing Rust for this project because I want to learn Rust. Along with that, it is a great way to learn Data Structures as well. So, this is a great way to get the best of both worlds.

I will get to be proficient with Rust as well as figure out how and why to use some Data structures over others.

# Text Editor
Since this is a personal and learning project, I am going to be using nvim to work on this project. This way, I also get to be familiar with my favorite editor.
